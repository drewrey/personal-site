I live in Atlanta. I work in Chamblee for [Cvent][Cvent] at the intersection of software enginerring and analytics.

Some of my current interests include web scraping for popular tv shows, empirical studies of sets of N with avoided differences, the NHL, and knitting.

I enjoy puzzles and boardgames. Crosswords, chess puzzles, etc. If you've got recommendations, please let me know.
