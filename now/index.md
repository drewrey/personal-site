I live in Atlanta. I work in Buckhead for [Cvent][Cvent] at the intersection of software engineering and analytics. I
recently began serving as a tech lead of a team, which has been a rewarding learning experience.

I'm starting to put together my first tech talk -- on [CORS][CORS] and some related topics. Have any advice for that?

Some of my current interests include composting, local policy, and urbanism.

I'd like to play more tennis. Wanna?
