I live in Atlanta. I work downtown for [Opendoor][Opendoor] building tools for the real estate industry. We're using Go, React, and new-to-me transport layers (protocol buffers, gRPC, GraphQL). I'm excited to contribute to the future of our tech stack.

Some of my current interests include microbobility, local policy, and urbanism.

I'm delighted to be getting married this year.

I'm not looking to start any long projects now, but if you'd like to get in touch for coffee, chess, or a racquet sport -- e-mail me!
