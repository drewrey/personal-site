I live in Atlanta. I work in Buckhead for [Cvent][Cvent] at the intersection of software enginerring and analytics.

Some of my current interests include [react][react], company knowledge transfer, and studying poetry and philosophy with my friends.  I've been working with a friend on [an app][virgil] to discuss and annotate content (poetry, philosophy, etc) à la [genius][genius] – come contribute!

I enjoy puzzles and boardgames. Crosswords, Tokaido, Innovation, etc.

Last updated September 2016.
