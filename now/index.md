I live in Atlanta. I work in Buckhead for [Cvent][Cvent] at the intersection of software enginerring and analytics.

Some of my current interests include [react][react], continuous integration, and company knowledge transfer. I've been working with a friend on [an app][virgil] to discuss and annotate content (poetry, philosophy, etc) à la [genius][genius] – come contribute! During the #MARTAHackathon, I worked on a [web app][TrainWhistle] to send text messages for MARTA trains.

I enjoy puzzles and boardgames. Crosswords, Tokaido, Innovation, etc.

I started roasting coffee. Wanna compare recipes?
