I live in Atlanta. I'm working at a stealth startup founded by Atomic.VC. We're building a platform using Elixir/GraphQL/Next.js. Stay tuned for more details.

I recently learned how to make pizza dough! It's a delight to be roll the dough and create a pie, and they're quick to make, too! It's on my TODO list to write up this process.

I'm not looking to start any long projects now, but if you'd like to get in touch for an outdoor walk or a virtual coffee/game -- e-mail me!
