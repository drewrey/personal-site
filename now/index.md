I live in Atlanta. I work in Buckhead for [Cvent][Cvent] at the intersection of software enginerring and analytics.

Some of my current interests include creating a diy Amazon echo, empirical studies of sets of N with avoided differences, and learning French.

I enjoy puzzles and boardgames. Crosswords, Tokaido, Innovation, etc.
