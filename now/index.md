I live in Atlanta. I work in Buckhead for [Cvent][Cvent] at the intersection of software engineering and analytics.

Some of my current interests include [react][react], continuous integration, and company knowledge transfer. In 2017, I will be travelling to see how other cities operate day-to-day.

I enjoy puzzles and boardgames. Crosswords, Tokaido, Innovation, etc.

Last updated December 2016.

In the spirit of Derek Sivers' [now page movement][now movement].
