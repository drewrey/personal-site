This is something I’ve been delighting in recently to use slack more asynchronously:

1. post a message in some channel
2. have slack “remind me” about the message
3. _work, break, work, break, repeat_  🎶
4. follow-up on slack’s reminder — if the message has not been reacted to appropriately, bump the item accordingly: by linking to it,  by `@`‘ing some person(s), etc
5. 💃
