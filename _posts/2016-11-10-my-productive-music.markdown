My current favorite music to be productive to:

- Yann Tiersen - Am√©lie
- Christine Rayner - The Calm of Einaudi
- Philip Glass - Glassworks

They seem to encourage focus in the way that they develop progressions. It also doesn't hurt that I've listened to these hundreds of times.

Have any recommendations for something similar?
