Often, the answer is (perhaps disappointingly) straightforward:

> _Step up_

But in the structures in which we find ourselves,
this can be confusing, counter-intuitive:
the local emphasis can be on short-term progress (sprints, quarters).

Ignore that.

Then, how do we promote doing more?

As a friend said to me once:

> _Model the shit out of it_

- Show people what success looks like
- Encourage little things
    - address tech debt
    - take grunt work from those around you to understand what support you’ve been getting
- Long-term wins happen through conversations, cross-team introductions
- Be vulnerable
    - if you’re experienced, ask questions about things that you don’t know — this provides a warm environment for others to ask questions
        - _i’m familiar with python 2, etc, but what is this unfamiliar syntax?_ // _oh, it’s from python 3!_
    - if you’re less experienced, ask questions that may seem dumb (but that everyone’s probably thinking) — this is a great way to learn!
        - _why not just do X?_
