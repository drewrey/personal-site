The best feature of Slack is its search functionality.

This turns it from the ephemeral chat of yesteryear to powerful source of institutional knowledge.

*But only if your organization is embracing that.*


Personal anecdote time:

Some background:

-------

Our company is an agglomeration of multiple start-ups. We’re located across multiple (7+) offices. Like [Conway’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law), a company’s Slack can come to resemble its organizational structure:
- Division A has a series of `#$A-*` channels
- Team 5 has a series of `#$5-*` channels
- some activity happens in shared `#$COMPANY-*` channels

 A common feature of these sub-groups was that each division/team would form its own series of private channels. Sometimes, these would be the default for new channels -- to preserve group identity and a sense of place. Sometimes, they would be incepted with some private info (DB credentials). But usually, this privation would be some sort of auto-pilot. As if each group should be inherently silo-ed from the others.

-------


I feel these private channels to largely be an anti-pattern.

Sure, there _are_ valid use cases for private channels — performance reviews and managerial discussions about how to deal with employees are certainly examples of discussions that should be private.

BUT!

If a conversation stands to benefit others in the company — people on other teams, future employees (who won’t know about #foo-private-channel), etc — *default to public channels*.

In this way, other teams & other people can potentially gain in this knowledge.


Here’s a transition plan for migrating away from private channels:
1. Rename private channel #foo to #foo-private
2. Create new channel #foo as public
3. Stop using #foo-private


Good candidates for such private channels that you may have:
- team channels
- divisional channels
- channels about X new initiative
- channels that don't have distinctly private information



This increase in transparency reduces the friction between groups within your company.
